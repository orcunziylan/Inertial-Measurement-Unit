# IMU Prototyping for Underwater Robotic Applications

Bachelor's Thesis - 2017

Welcome to the repository for my Bachelor's thesis project conducted in 2017. This project focuses on the prototyping of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) tailored for underwater robotic applications. 

## Overview

In this project, I explore the integration of sensor measurements to achieve precise orientation and position estimation. By combining the data streams from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, I implemented the Kalman filter algorithm to enhance the accuracy of the calculated results.

## Tested on Kuka Agilus

The developed IMU prototype was tested on the Kuka Agilus robotic platform. This testing phase allowed us to validate the effectiveness of the sensor fusion technique in a real-world scenario.
